# Project-Trousersnake

Roadkill Gantry Board (affectionately referred to as project trousersnake) is an alternative to running a z chain on the voron 2.4 and similar flying gantry 3D printers. It utilises the roadkill standard for the toolhead passthrough, as developed by the makerbogans: https://github.com/MakerBogans/roadkill

The gantry board takes 2 20 core IDC cables from the base (or top) of your printer from the electronics bay. 1 cable takes 4x motors, chamber thermistor and an endstop. The second cable takes the full toolhead which is passed through directly to the passthrough connector. The recommended way of using the toolhead passthrough is with the roadkill redirector board mounted to the top of the gantry with a short length of cable between it and the gantry board.

The image below is of an installation in a 2.4 with rear mounted electronics and the base board mounted at the top. This printer is not utilising the roadkill passthrough to the toolhead in the photos.
